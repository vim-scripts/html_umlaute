Useful for all people who edit german websites with Vim.
On loading a HTML file, this script replaces all the html-encoded german Umlaute (&*uml;) with their normal Ascii-Chars (ä,ö,ü, and ß) so they're more easily readable.

When you save the file, all Ascii-Chars are replaced by the HTML Encoding. Could be extended to handle other chars as well (except for < > and " which could only be replaced context-sensitive...) but I decided to use it only for these german letters...
